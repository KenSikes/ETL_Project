# ETL_Project

Proposal: Thomas and I are young, aspiring Data Scientists fresh off the new hire line at Nasa. Day one we have a project coming straight from the top. The Director of NASA wants us to comb through the Confirmed Exoplanet dataset and the Kepler Objects of interest database to analyze the exoplanets that fall in both datasets and the common parameters they share.
